# Hi, I'm Luiz Gustavo!
Iâ€™m a Brazilian developer and Computer Science student at UTFPR (5th semester) with a Technical Degree in Informatics from UTF (completed in 2022). I have hands-on experience with React and Next.js, a strong interest in C/C++ and game programming, and Iâ€™m currently focusing my studies on **Go** and backend architecture.

## ðŸ‘€ Interests
Iâ€™m improving my skills in React and Next.js, expanding my knowledge of data structures and game programming, and diving into backend development with Go - specially APIs, architecture and observability.

## ðŸ’¼ Experience
I have web development experience with React and Next.js, having contributed to e-commerce features, data validation and user registration flows, and using tools like shadcn, Tailwind and Zod. In academic and personal projects I implemented RESTful APIs for rental properties (CRUD endpoints, reservation flows, authentication and persistence with PostgreSQL) and a WhatsApp bot for notifications and scheduling via messaging APIs. I also work with Git, Docker, unit testing, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
